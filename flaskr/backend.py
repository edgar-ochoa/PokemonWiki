"""This module contains the backend of the pokemon wiki which interacts with the Google Cloud Storage.
The backend retrieves user generated pages and image data from the cloud, creates username and password blobs, creates hashed passwords,
compares username and password blobs for logging in, and uploads user generated page data to the cloud.

Typical Usage:
backend = Backend()
data = backend.get_wiki_page('charmander')
pages = backend.get_all_page_names()
backend.upload('charmander.png', pokemon_dictionary)
signup = backend.sign_up('javier', 'pokemon123')
login = backend.sign_in('javier', 'pokemon123')
image = get_image('pokemon/charmander')
